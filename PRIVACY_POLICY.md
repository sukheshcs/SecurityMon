# Privacy Policy for SecurityMon

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how SecurityMon ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our Windows application.

## 1. No Data Collection
**SecurityMon does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.** 

We do not have access to your:
- System logs
- Network activity
- Running process list
- Personal files

## 2. Local Data Storage
All data generated by the application is stored **locally on your device**.
- **Activity Logs**: Stored in your local user `AppData` folder (`activity_log.jsonl`).
- **Settings**: Stored locally in your application preferences.
- **Exported Reports**: CSV reports are generated only upon your explicit request and saved to the location you specify.

## 3. System Permissions
SecurityMon requires elevated (Administrator) permissions to function as a system utility. These permissions are used strictly for:
- **Process Management**: Terminating processes you explicitly select (Kill Switch).
- **Startup Management**: Removing registry keys or shortcuts for startup applications you choose to delete.
- **Monitoring**: Reading system performance counters (CPU, RAM) and network connection states.

These actions are never performed automatically without user configuration or interaction, and no data regarding these actions is sent to third parties.
